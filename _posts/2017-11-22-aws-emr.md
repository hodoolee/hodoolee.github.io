In this post, I will be setting up the Zepplin Notebook using AWS EMR(Elastic MapReduce). It is almost like the Jupyter Notebook but was created specifically for Big Data(Spark, Hadoop, etc). The current version is 0.7 and supports multiple languages.

## Set-up
I proceeded without an EC2 key pair just for demo purpose.

{% include image.html subdir=page.subdir name='aws_emr_1.png' caption='Pic 1: Creating a AWS EMR cluster' %}

{% include image.html subdir=page.subdir name='aws_emr_2.png' caption='Pic 2: Cluster is running' %}

Add security rules of SSH and Custom TCP Rule(port 8890) on EMR-master for my current my IP address.  

After the cluster has created, I can access to the Notebook through "Master public DNS".

Now, let's create our first Notebook!

## Zepplin Notebook

The first thing is do in the cell is adding "%pyspark" and everything else in the cell can be in Python code. Otherwise, it expects Scala.

Luckly, the Zepplin Notebook creates a sequel context ready(sc) and even deal with data in AWS S3 bucket.
