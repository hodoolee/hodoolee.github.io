## **Attributes of a process:**

#### **1) PID**

#### **2) Program counter**
Assume we have 10 instructions, I_1, I_2, ..., I_10 and if we stop the execution at I_6, then the program counter remembers the next instruction so that it keeps on executing it without any repetition.

#### **3) Process state**

#### **4) Priority**
Whenever any process is created by OS then it will generally assign something called a priority. So the process with higher priority is executed first.

#### **5) General purpose registers**

#### **6) List of open files**

#### **7) List of open devices**
It represents printers, scanners and hardware devices.

#### **8) Protection**
