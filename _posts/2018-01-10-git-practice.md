## Git Stash 

`git stash` is a command that it stores all of the changes away. What so great about is that you can come back to the code anytime that you had stashed away. So I recommend to use it when there is an emergency bugfix.

```bash
# use -u flag to grab everything and get back to an empty status 
$ git stash -u
```
