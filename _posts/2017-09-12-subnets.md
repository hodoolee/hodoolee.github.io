In the real world of industry, they don't want a big network because it is going to be really hard to maintain with security issues. So generally, what they do is that they divide it into some smaller networks and this is called **subnetting**. Although, there are disadvantages of subnetting(the identification is more complex because it involes with more steps), advantages are more prominent.

## **Divide into 2 subnets**
We need one bit to divide into 2 subnets. So the first subnet starts with 0 and the second subnet starts with 1. For example, let's say we have a network in ```200.1.2.0```. Then we know it falls in class C and NID is the first three octets and HID is the last octet. Two subnets are connected with an internal router and it first gets the packet when an external router sends to this network.

It is important to know where the packet was sent. So for example, if the packet is sent from the external router with
```200.1.2.255```, then it broadcasts the entire network. However, if the packet is sent inside the network with ```200.1.2.255```, then it broadcasts the entire second subnet.

2<sup>8</sup> = 256 IP addresses available  
2<sup>8</sup> - 2 = 254 hosts available(because first address is given as NID and the last as DBA)

**S1:** The first subnet has a range of addresses from 0 to 127.

Last octet  | Range
:---: | :---:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 0
... | ...
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | 127

This network has SID ```200.1.2.0``` and DBA ```200.1.2.127```.

**S2:** The second subnet has a range of addresses from 128 to 255.

Last octet  | Range
:---: | :---:
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 128
... | ...
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | 255

This network has SID ```200.1.2.128``` and DBA ```200.1.2.255```.

## **Divide into 4 subnets**
We need two bits to divide into 4 subnets. In 4 subnets, nearly 8 IP addresses are wasted.

Subnet | 2-bits | Range | NID | DBA
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
S1 | 00 | 0-63 | 0 | 63
S2 | 01 | 64-127 | 64 | 127
S3 | 10 | 128-191 | 128 | 191
S4 | 11 | 192-255 | 192 | 255

If the bellow packet is sent from the external router, then the internal router gets the packet and identify it and deliver to S1.

M | SA | DA

## **Subnet Mask**

It is 32-bits number and has only 0 and 1.  

1's represent NID & SID  
0's represent HID  

In the 4 subnets with ```200.1.2.0```, it has a subnet mask ```11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000```. 24-bits(NID) + 2-bits(SID) + 6-bits(HID). In decimal system, it is ```255.255.255.192```.

Let's say ```200.1.2.130``` packet is sent. Then we need to figure out that where it belongs to. So using subnet mask, 

1. convert into bits
  - ```200.1.2.130``` => ```11001000.00000001.00000010.10000010```
2. bitwise with AND operation
  - ```11001000.00000001.00000010.10000000```

 |  |  |  | 
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
Subnet Mask(Binary) | 11111111. | 11111111. | 11111111. | 11000000
 | AND | AND | AND | 
IP | 11001000. | 00000001. | 00000010. | 10000010
Output(Binary) | 11001000. | 00000001. | 00000010. | 10000000
Output(Decimal) | 200. | 1. | 2. | 128

The IP address ```200.1.2.130``` belongs to the network ```200.1.2.128```.

Routing Table:

NID | SM | Interface
:---: | :---: | :---:
200.1.2.0 | 255.255.255.192 | a
200.1.2.64 | 255.255.255.192 | b
200.1.2.128 | 255.255.255.192 | c
200.1.2.192 | 255.255.255.192 | d
0.0.0.0 | 0.0.0.0 | e

If the result matches with NID, then it sends the packet over the interface. If it does not match, it compares with the next entry. If the entire entries don't match, then it sends out through the default entry.
