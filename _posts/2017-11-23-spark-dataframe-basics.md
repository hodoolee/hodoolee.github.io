- Spark DataFrames hold data in a column and row foramt
- Each column represents feature or variable
- Each row represents an individual data point
- Spark has **RDD** syntax which is a little tricky to learn but version >= 2.0 has shifted towards a DataFrame syntax and become much cleaner and easier
- We can input/output data from variety of sources and use these DataFRames to apply transformations on the data so that we show or collect the results to display the final result
